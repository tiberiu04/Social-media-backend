#### SOCIAL NETWORK - HOMEWORK 3

#### TASK 1 : FRIENDS NETWORK MANAGMENT

This project implements a simple friends network management system,
allowing users to perform various operations such as
- `add` : adding friends
- `remove` : removing friends
- `suggestions` : suggesting new friends
- `distance` : finding distance between users
- `common` : finding common friends
- `friends` : counting how many friends there are
- `popular` : identifying the most popular friend.

#### Concepts used:
- *data stuctures* :

1. **Graph** : Represents the network with nodes as users and edges as
friendships.
2. **Adjacency List** : Efficient for sparse graphs, allowing fast traversal.

- *algorithms* :

1. **BFS** : Used to calculate the shortest distance between two users.
2. **Iteration**: Used for suggesting friends and finding common friends.

#### Steps Taken:

1. **Graph Representation** : Implemented using an adjacency list.
2. **Command Parsing** : Used strtok for parsing commands.
3. **Add/Remove Operations** : Managed bidirectional connections.
4. **Distance Calculation** : Implemented BFS.
5. **Suggestions** : Iterated over friends of friends.
6. **Common Friends** : Checked for mutual friends.
7. **Popularity Check** : Compared number of connections.

##### --------- COMMANDS -----------

##### `add`

This command creates a mutual connection between two users. Both users
will have each other listed as friends.

When you use the `add` command and type in two names, it’s like you’re
helping two people meet and become friends.

The app makes sure each person is recognized as unique, then updates
their friend lists so each knows about the other.Following this
identification process, each user's list of connections is updated to
include the other.

##### `remove`

Deletes the existing friendship link between two specified users.

Upon receiving the command, the project retrieves the identifiers associated
with the given names and proceeds to remove each user from the other's
list of friends. This operation is direct and efficient.

##### `distance`

Finds the minimum number of friendships (edges) between two users.

The command takes two names, converts them into their respective IDs, and
employs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This search method starts
at one user and radiates outwards, layer by layer, until it either locates
the second user or exhausts all connections. The number of layers traversed
during this search represents the social distance between the two individuals.

##### `suggestions`

Proposes non-friend second-degree connections as potential friends.

This command offers a glimpse into potential friendships by identifying
friends of friends who are not yet directly connected to the user.

After determining the central user’s ID, the project examines the
friends of this user’s friends, compiling a list of unique individuals.

##### `common`

Lists friends common to both specified users.

If you want to see who you and another person both know, you can use the
`common` command. The app looks at both your friend lists and tells you who’s
on both.

After retrieving the lists of friends for both users, the code finds
the intersection of these lists, revealing shared connections

##### `friends`

Reports the number of direct connections a user has.

This command provides a straightforward count of a user’s direct connections.
This count is quickly retrieved from the user’s adjacency list, offering a
snapshot of their social involvement within the network.

##### `popular`

Identifies the friend with the highest number of connections from a user’s
friend list.

The `popular` command seeks to identify the most connected individual within
a user’s circle. By examining the number of connections each friend has, the
project determines who among them is the most influential or, in other words,
the most popular. In cases of a tie, the system favors either the user
themselves or the first friend listed.

### TASK 2 POSTS MANAGMENT

#### Concepts used:
- *data stuctures* :

1. **Generic tree** : Represents the network with root as post and children as
reposts.

- *algorithms* :

1. **Lowest common ancestor** : Used to calculate the lowest common repost for
two reposts.
2. **Iteration through the tree**: Used for accesing the values from the nodes.
